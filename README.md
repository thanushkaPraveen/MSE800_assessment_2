## Architecture Patterns

- **MVC:** Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture.
- **Model:** Data & Business Logic - The Model represents the data, business logic, and rules of the application. It 
communicates with the database and processes the data.
- **View:** User Interface (UI) - The View is responsible for displaying data and rendering the user interface. It 
interacts with the Model indirectly through the Controller.
- **Controller:** Controller (C) - Handles User Interaction - The Controller acts as a mediator between the Model and 
the View. It processes user input, retrieves data from the Model, and updates the View accordingly.

---

## Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern:** Used for dynamically creating database connection instances.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures that only one database connection instance exists at any given time.
- **Observer Pattern:** Facilitates notification of users about booking status changes (e.g., via email).

---

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Suggest cars to users based on their preferences.
- **Mobile Integration:** Develop a Flutter-based mobile application.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Implement surge pricing during high-demand periods.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Use APIs for updates and reminders.
- **Dynamic Search:** Add filters for price range, car type, mileage, and availability.
- **Multi-language Support:** Offer a language selector.
- **Multi-currency Support:** Enable payments in different currencies.

---

## Testing and Debugging

### Testing

- **Integration Testing:** Ensures end-to-end workflows function correctly.
- **Manual Testing:** Verifies CLI functionality for various inputs.

### Debugging

- **Logging:** Use logging for database operations and exception handling.
- **Configuration Validation:** Validate configurations before deployment.
